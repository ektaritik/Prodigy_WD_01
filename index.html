      Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. It is our
      companion since eternity. Despite the importance of nature in human life,
      we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness. Millions of years
      ago, when the knowledge of man was not better than an animal. At that time
      man used to get all the things needed for life only from nature. Even
      today, at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only.
      Nature is a boon given to us, as it protects crores and crores of
      organisms living on the earth. It gives us forests which are the lungs of
      Earth.Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since
      then we are exhausting its resources. But, in return, we are exposing it
      to the external threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this,
      beautiful forests have been destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast
      open lands have been consumed for buildings and factories. We are giving
      challenges to nature by doing activities as hunting down animals, cutting
      down trees, releasing poisonous gases and polluting rivers.
    
      All the beautiful things on planet earth- plants, animals, birds,
      mountains and rivers- are part of nature. The gifts of nature are indeed
      uncountable. It provides us with shelter, resources and much more. The
      beauty of nature fills our hearts with joy and peace. And most important
      of all, nature is what supports life. Forests give us air to breathe,
      while rivers and lakes give us water to drink. Nature keeps the cycle of
      life going on.However, in recent years, the exploitation of nature by
      humans has led to dire consequences. Deforestation and pollution have
      adversely affected nature, creating a deep wound that will take many years
      to heal. Thus, we must try our best to protect nature from further harm.
      To conclude, it is our responsibility to protect the beauty of nature, and
      we must never forget it! Thank you for listening to me so attentively.
